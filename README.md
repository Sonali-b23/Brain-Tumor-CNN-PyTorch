# Brain-Tumor-CNN-PyTorch
A CNN-based brain tumor classification project using PyTorch on MRI images. Implements binary classification (tumor vs non-tumor) with model evaluation, checkpointing, and visualization. Ideal for medical imaging research and early-stage AI applications in healthcare. Built using PyTorch, NumPy, OpenCV, and scikit-learn.
